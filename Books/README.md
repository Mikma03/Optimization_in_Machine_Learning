# Books explaining optimization


This section will be dedicated to showing you books that explain optimization concepts well and are available for purchase or download.

In my opinion, books are the best material for imparting knowledge, which is why I believe that the following two publications are the best in terms of audience acquisition.

Books are available in a modern form, i.e. text plus working codes in a given language.

The ability to apply function optimization freely allows us to go to a new level in various stages of machine learning. We may find better models by hyperparameter tuning. We may also produce better input data by feature selection in preprocessing stage.

Machine learning is doing a lot of optimization behind the scenes. When new algorithm invented or new technique proposed, it is inevitable to explain them in terms of optimization. Hence we also need to understand them from optimization perspectives.

This book was carefully designed to help you bring a wide variety of the proven and powerful optimization algorithms to your next project.

The tutorials were designed to teach you these techniques the fastest and most effective way that I know how: to learn by doing. With executable code that you can run to develop the intuitions required, and that you can copy-and-paste into your project and immediately get a result.

Function optimization is important to machine learning, and I believe that if it is taught at the right level for practitioners, it can be a fascinating, fun, directly applicable, and immeasurably useful toolbox of techniques.

Genetic algorithms are a family of search, optimization, and learning algorithms inspired by the principles of natural evolution. By imitating the evolutionary process, genetic algorithms can overcome hurdles encountered in traditional search algorithms and provide high-quality solutions for a variety of problems. This book will help you get to grips with a powerful yet simple approach to applying genetic algorithms to a wide range of tasks using Python, covering the latest developments in artificial intelligence.

After introducing you to genetic algorithms and their principles of operation, you'll understand how they differ from traditional algorithms and what types of problems they can solve. You'll then discover how they can be applied to search and optimization problems, such as planning, scheduling, gaming, and analytics. As you advance, you'll also learn how to use genetic algorithms to improve your machine learning and deep learning models, solve reinforcement learning tasks, and perform image reconstruction. Finally, you'll cover several related technologies that can open up new possibilities for future applications.

By the end of this book, you'll have hands-on experience of applying genetic algorithms in artificial intelligence as well as in numerous other domains.
