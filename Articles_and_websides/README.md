We propose a path-integral Monte Carlo quantum annealing scheme for the symmetric traveling-salesman problem, based on a highly constrained Ising-like representation, and we compare its performance against standard thermal simulated annealing. The Monte Carlo moves implemented are standard, and consist in restructuring a tour by exchanging two links (two-opt moves). The quantum annealing scheme, even with a drastically simple form of kinetic energy, appears definitely superior to the classical one, when tested on a 1002-city instance of the standard TSPLIB.

The Simulated Annealing algorithm is based upon Physical Annealing in real life. Physical Annealing is the process of heating up a material until it reaches an annealing temperature and then it will be cooled down slowly in order to change the material to a desired structure. When the material is hot, the molecular structure is weaker and is more susceptible to change. When the material cools down, the molecular structure is harder and is less susceptible to change.
